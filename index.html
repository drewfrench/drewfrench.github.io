		<h2 id="thesis">Sir Isaac Newton's new math and science was the catalyst for the Industrial Revolution. Long after Newton's death, a culture of technological advancement developed in England and eventually spread globally. This culture—common knowledge of Newton's new higher math and laws of motion—gave mankind the tools needed for the Industrial Revolution and changed the world forever.</h2>

			<br>
			<p class="caption">This is HRH Prince Albert’s ticket to the 1851 international Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry to All Nations. Queen Victoria’s Consort organized this celebration of the latest, new, modern industrial technology and design. The ticket is numbered “I” and held in a red leather pocket case. It is on display at the Victoria and Albert Museum, England.</p>
			<p class="caption">This exhibition is responsible for quickly spreading the IR around the world because “Six million people visited the Crystal Palace to see cutting-edge science and technology…” (Williams 1).  Historian Liza Picard wrote for the British Library:</p>
			<p class="caption">“Queen Victoria opened the Exhibition on 1 May, on schedule. She became a frequent visitor. At first the price of admission was £3 for gentlemen, £2 for ladies. They came in throngs, in their elegant carriages, leaving them at a separate entrance to be valet-parked. Saturday mornings were reserved for invalids. From 24th May the masses were let in for only a shilling a head. And they came in their thousands, factory workers sent by their employers, country villagers sent by benevolent landowners, strings of schoolchildren. The country men came wearing their best smocks, staring at all the Londoners and foreigners. The travel agent Thomas Cook arranged special excursion trains. A third-class return ticket from York cost only five shillings. One old lady even walked, all the way from Penzance. There was even a mysterious Chinese man in full mandarin robes, who stepped forward as the royal procession passed. He was treated, just in case he was important, as a visiting dignitary, but he turned out to be the captain of a Chinese junk moored in the river.” (Picard 1)</p>

			<p class="caption">Within this article’s extensive examination of the Crystal Palace as it looked during the Great Exhibition of 1851, there is map that shows the impact of the IR and the resulting industrialization as it spread out from England. This map illustrates the spread of the IR after Britain’s 1851 The Great Exhibition. “Six million people visited the Crystal Palace to see cutting-edge science and technology…” (Williams 1) and industrialization fanned out from England not long afterwards.</p>

			<p class="caption">Artists painted pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851 for Prince Albert and they were compiled into a 1854 book called Dickinsons' Comprehensive Pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851, from the originals painted for Prince Albert.  The British Library’s Picture #7 from this book shows a machinery room with the exhibition. “More than 100,000 objects were displayed by over 14,000 exhibiters from around the world, grouped into four principal themes: Machinery, Manufactures, Fine Arts and Raw Materials. Included in the exhibits were full scale hydraulic presses, steam engines, carriages, fire-arms, porcelain, enamels, carpets, textiles and even the 186 carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, among thousands upon thousands more artefacts (many of which are shown in this sequence)” (Nash 1).</p>

			<p class="caption">Although an ironmonger (nail maker and tool seller to mining industry) from rural England, Newcomer was familiar with Sir Isaac Newton’s new science through Robert Hooke of the Royal Society. Newton’s new science—physics—required higher mathematics skills and England’s schools had been teaching Newton’s new math since 1720, thanks to the popularity of Newton’s book, the Principia, and the Newtonian Culture that sprang up after Newton’s death.</p>

			<p class="caption">Newcomen’s steam engine is first functioning steam engine. Newcomen’s first steam engine was improved upon and lead to James Watt’s steam engine and locomotive travel.</p>
			<p class="caption">Although many others had tried before him, it took Thomas Newcomer ten years to develop the first functioning steam engine.  Newcomer was added by his friend, John Calley (or Cawley) who was a plumber.  Newcomen’s early steam engine was built to pump water out of England’s flooded coal and tin mines and was pivotal to the growth of the Industrial Revolution around the world. Newcomen’s first steam engine was improved upon and lead to James Watt’s steam engine and locomotive travel.</p>

			<p class="caption">A page from a book by one of Newton's experimental assistants. J. T. Desaguliers promoted the new Newtonian math and science in his 500-page book. Historians have proven that this illustration led to the invention of the steam engine and the waterwheel.</p>
			<p class="caption">J. T. Desaguliers was an experimental assistant to Isaac Newton and after Newton’s death, promoter the new Newtonian math and science via his 500 page book. Additionally Desaguliers educated the public through lectures to “almost any skilled craftsman, merchant, or self-improving listener” (Dobbs 78) at the beginning of the spread of the Newtonian Culture.  There are many illustrations in Desagulier’s Course of Experimental Philosophies (science was called a philosophy at the beginning of the IR). This one is significant because it illustrates how humans struggle against gravity and inertia, and how these forces can be measured.  The Newtonian mechanics in this illustration lead to the invention of the steam engine and waterwheel decades later (Dobbs 79), due to to the spread of the Newtonian Culture.</p>
