		<h1 id="title">Newtonian Culture and the Industrial Revolution</h1>
		<h2 id="thesis">Sir Isaac Newton's new math and science was the catalyst for the Industrial Revolution. Long after Newton's death, a culture of technological advancement developed in England and eventually spread globally. This culture—common knowledge of Newton's new higher math and laws of motion—gave mankind the tools needed for the Industrial Revolution and changed the world forever.</h2>
