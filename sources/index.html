		<p>Desaguliers, John Theophilus. A Course of Experimental Philosophy.W. Innys, 1744, 
	archive.org/details/oo27ACOU. Accessed 14 Mar. 2017.
J. T. Desaguliers was an experimental assistant to Isaac Newton and one of Newton’s first followers to promote the new math and science through public speaking and via this 500 page primary source book. In his lifetime J. T. Desaguliers gave over 140 courses of about 20 lectures on mechanics to audiences including King George I. Therefore, his book is reliable.  After Newton’s death, Desaguliers educated the public through lectures to “almost any skilled craftsman, merchant, or self-improving listener” (Dobbs 78) at the beginning of the spread of the Newtonian Culture.  There are many illustrations in Desagulier’s A Course of Experimental Philosophy (science was called philosophy at the beginning of the IR) from pages 428- 429. One is significant because it illustrates how humans struggle against gravity and inertia, and how these forces can be measured.  I will use this drawing because it is a good example of Newton’s new physics, easily understood by an uneducated audience.  The Newtonian mechanics in this illustration lead to the invention of the steam engine and waterwheel decades later (Dobbs 79)., In my paper, I will discuss the importance of this source in the spread of the Newtonian Culture.

“The Great Exhibition: Queen Victoria's Journal.”  Victoria and Albert Museum, 2016, 
	http://www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/great-exhibition-queen-victorias-journal/.
This primary source image is HRH Prince Albert’s ticket to the 1851 international Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry to All Nations. It is from the collection of one of the major museums from around the world, the Victoria & Albert Museum, so it is a reliable source. Queen Victoria’s Consort organized this celebration of the latest, new, modern industrial technology and design. The ticket is numbered “I”, held in a red leather pocket case, and in the Victoria and Albert Museum’s collection in England. The Great Exhibition is responsible for quickly spreading the IR around the world, because “Six million people visited the Crystal Palace to see cutting-edge science and technology…” (Williams 1). A historian for the British Museum wrote about the cost of attendance, “They came in throngs, in their elegant carriages, leaving them at a separate entrance to be valet-parked. Saturday mornings were reserved for invalids. From 24th May the masses were let in for only a shilling a head” (Picard 1).

Leibniz, Gottfried Wilhelm. The Lever of Riches: Technological Creativity and Economic 
	Progress. written by Joel Mokyr, Oxford University Press, 1990, p. 188.
Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz was a respected German mathematician in the 18th century. Leibniz’ quote about trading between countries is printed in another book covering technological advancement. The primary source shows the historical context of the exchange of Chinese inventions with Europe. In my paper, I will use this source to show the difference between the global, sociocultural context of the mid-18th century and compare it to the global, sociocultural context which existed by the mid-19th century. The author of the book in which the original text is printed is Joel Mokyr, a Netherlands-born American-Israeli economic historian. He is the Robert H. Strotz Professor of Arts and Sciences and professor of economics and history at Northwestern University. Oxford University Press is one of the most prestigious publishing companies in the world.

Leucippus and Democritus. The Atomists, Leucippus and Democritus: Fragments: A Text and
Translation with a Commentary by C. C. W. Taylor. Toronto: University of Toronto
Press Incorporated, 1999, 	books.google.com/books?id=i_1u3X4yqdAC&pg=PA157&lpg=PA157&dq=democritus+primary+source&source=bl&ots=-lHyXfSIQu&sig=l4ElzicV3hRaep5U7- va8kVmwyk&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwi72OuKh8jJAhXLlB4KHcj6CtsQ6AEILjAC#v=onepage&q=democritus%20primary%20source&f=false. Accessed 6 Dec. 2015. 
This is a translated primary source book, with original texts and fragments of texts from many ancient philosophers, including Democritus’ writing about atomism. Some of the fragments are written in the actual Ancient Greek language, so it is credible. This important source provides crucial, actual quotes from Democritus about the ancient atomist theory. In my paper, I will use an actual direct quote about the primary structure of the world—an atom—within pages 69-90, for which some scientists dubbed Democritus the “Father of Modern Science” for multiple centuries. Democritus is first on many timelines of Modern Science, including a diagram of the history of physics outside Prof. Jay’s classroom.

Nash, Joseph, and Louis Haghe, Louis, and David Roberts. Dickinsons' Comprehensive Pictures 
	of the Great Exhibition of 1851, from the originals painted for Prince Albert. Dickinson 
	Brothers, 1854, https://archive.org/stream/Dickinsonscompr1#page/n9/mode/2up. 
	Accessed 26 Mar., 2017.
A few chosen artists painted pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851 and they were compiled into a 1854 book called Dickinsons' Comprehensive Pictures of the Great Exhibition of 1851, from the originals painted for Prince Albert. This primary source is credible, because they were painted for Prince Albert. Recently, this book was digitized for the general public and I use one picture in my project, British Library’s Picture #7, which shows a machinery room within the Great Exhibition. “More than 100,000 objects were displayed by over 14,000 exhibitors from around the world, grouped into four principal themes: Machinery, Manufactures, Fine Arts and Raw Materials. Included in the exhibits were full scale hydraulic presses, steam engines, carriages, fire-arms, porcelain, enamels, carpets, textiles and even the 186 carat Koh-i-Noor diamond, among thousands upon thousands more artefacts (many of which are shown in this sequence)” (Nash 1).

Newton, Sir Isaac. Method of Fluxions. Henry Woodfall, 1736, 
www.maa.org/press/periodicals/convergence/mathematical-treasure-newtons-method-of-fluxions. Accessed 20 Feb. 2017.
This primary source was written by Sir Issac Newton before he wrote his more famous Principia.  It was formally published decades posthumously. Therefore, this book is reliable. I use this source in my paper because it has all the complete parts of Newton’s newly invented calculus. From it, I will paraphrase from pages 44 and 45 where Newton considered the determination of maximum and minimum points for a curve. This calculation was used many times in IR inventions, and thus Newton’s new math significantly advanced the IR.

Newton, Sir Isaac. Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (the Principia). Translated by 
	Andrew Motte, Prometheus Books, 1995.
This is an original primary source by Sir Issac Newton, translated by Andrew Motte of the respected Motte family publishing company. This edition is known as the "authorized version" because it is the most commonly taught version in English.  Therefore, it is respected. The Enlightenment paved the way for geniuses like Sir Isaac Newton to explore new scientific ideas, not inhibited by the dogma of religion. Since the Principia is written by the mathematician and inventor of calculus himself, it is a credible source. It was originally known by its longer Latin name, Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica and sometimes throughout the centuries known by its English translation, Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy. Today the same book by Sir Isaac Newton is commonly printed with only the shorter version of the Principia. Within the Principia, there are two books and many of Newton’s theorems are outlined. In this source, Newton reveals his “new science”, i.e. laws of motion, which had a long term impact, well into the Modern Age.  In my paper, I will paraphrase Newton’s new laws of motion from the Principia which were so critical to the IR. More specifically, I will use a quote about the fundamental idea behind integration used in parts of calculus from Book I page1. 

Newton, Sir Isaac. The Physics Book 250 Milestones in the History of Physics. written by 
	Clifford A. Pickover, Barnes & Noble, Inc., 2013, p. 112.
This Isaac Newton quote, “God Created everything by number, eight, and measure”, is printed in a physics book whose respected author has written more than thirty resource science and math books. Clifford Pickover is also Editor-in-Chief of the IBM Journal of Research and Development, and thus his book is credible. I plan to use this famous quote at the beginning of my paper because it shows how Newton viewed the world from a mathematical perspective, and used reasoning, all interconnected with his concept of God and religion. Because this quote was said by Newton himself, it is credible.

Newton, Sir Isaac. “Letter from Newton to Francis Aston” The Newton Project Cambridge 
	University Library, 2013, 
	www.newtonproject.ox.ac.uk/view/texts/normalized/NATP00227. Accessed 12 Mar. 
	2017.
This original letter by Sir Isaac Newton shows how select 17th century individuals were worldly. It give historical context and in my paper, I will use it to compare how worldly many more people were by the time of the 1850’s when the general public attended the Great Exhibition. This primary source letter also shows how Newton spread his new science and new math at the start of the Newtonian Culture.

Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. Extracts from Queen 
	Victoria's Journal, 1851. Quoted in Gibbs-Smith, Charles Harvard, The Great Exhibition 
	of 1851 Sec.ed, H.M.S.O., 1981, 
	www.vam.ac.uk/content/articles/g/great-exhibition-queen-victorias-journal/. Accessed 13 
	Mar. 2017.
Queen Victoria was Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and one of the longest reigning monarchs, so her journals are credible. Charles Harvard Gibbs-Smith is an expert on Queen Victoria, her writings, and her life. Parts of her journals, from within Gibbs-Smith’s book, are reproduced on the Victoria and Albert Museum’s website.  From the Queen’s journals, I will use a quote about the large number of people who attended the opening day of the Great Exhibition. The journal entry “1 May 1851… a wonderful spectacle, crowds streaming through it, - carriages and troops passing…” (Victoria 1) is in my paper and serves as a sociocultural, global comparison to the context of the 17th century.

Walker, George. Woman Spinning. 1814. The Costume of Yorkshire, 
	http://www.historyhome.co.uk/pict2/cottind.jpg. Accessed 12 Apr. 2017.
Artist George Walker was commissioned by a local bookseller to produce a series of paintings known as The Costume of Yorkshire in 1814. During his lifetime, Walker primarily painted local and rural life.  “Woman Spinning” is one of the engravings from this series and is a primary source. This image is from the website created by Marjie Bloy who studied to be a teacher at Alnwick College of Education, Northumberland, England and taught secondary education for eighteen years. Afterwards, she taught at Rotherham College of Arts and Technology and the University of Sheffield where she received her PhD in history.  Her educational website is a reliable source.  From it, I wrote to England for permission to use a photograph of a typical textile cottage industry before the IR.  The engraving is an example of the textile cottage industry in 1814 and multiple people work to make one garment—dyeing, spinning and weaving.</p>

	Houston, 1988-2011, http://www.uh.edu/engines/epi2728.htm. Accessed 26 Mar. 2017.
This secondary source is an informational website from the University of Houston on great inventions. The picture used is from the “Engines of our Ingenuity” series written by NASA astronaut Michael Barratt. Therefore, it is reliable. This Victorian waterwheel on the Isle of Man was built in 1854 to pump water from the local lead, copper, silver and zinc mines.  It is called the Laxey Wheel and operated until the mines closed in 1929.  The waterwheel was one of the most important inventions of the IR and it’s mechanics stemmed directly from Sir Isaac Newton’s book, the Principia, knowledge that was spread via the Newtonian Culture.

Bekar, Clifford, and Richard G. Lipsey. “Science, Institutions, & the Industrial Revolution.” 
	Simon Fraser University, 2002, pp. 1, 5, 5-6, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 
	http://www.sfu.ca/econ-research/discussion/dp02-4.pdf. Accessed 6 Feb. 2017.
The two authors of this scholarly pdf article are economics professors at Lewis and Clark College. Clifford Bekar has a Ph.D. from Simon Fraser University and has published many economic books, including with the co-author on this article. Richard G. Lipsey has his Ph.D. from London School of Economics and has also won many prestigious awards like the Order of Canada. The respected Simon Fraser University, Canada made their writings available online via a pdf. Thus, this article is credible. This secondary source article provides many quotes important to understanding the Newtonian Culture. The source proves why the IR happened first in England, not elsewhere. It establishes the importance of Sir Isaac Newton’s revolutionary book, the Principia. This two economics professors accept the commonly held view that “trial-and-error advances in technology lead advances in sciences” (Bekar 1) but value more highly math and Newton’s new theorems in the Principia as the source of new technological advances. In my paper, I plan to use quotes from 8 pages of this relevant article.

“The British Empire.” The Victorian School, 2011, 
	http://www.victorianschool.co.uk/empire.html.
The Victorian School is an educational website and classroom component used in many English schools. Its purpose is to give school children information about the Victorian Age.  The Headmaster says: “We are working as hard as we can to get more information on the site, but we are also busy with school visits and helping with Victorian projects.”  From this reliable source, I use a photograph of a map of the British Empire during Victorian Times and this quote, “The Great Exhibition of 1851, the very first World's Fair, was a celebration of the diversity and richness of the Empire.”

Betty Jo Teeter Dobbs was a historian specializing in Isaac Newton. The other author, Margaret Jacob, is a history professor at UCLA and was educated at Cornell University. She has won many awards including the Guggenheim Fellowship for Humanities, US & Canada This history book is a reliable, secondary source for my paper and website. From this important source, I develop the name Newtonian Culture. Page 61 starts a discussion of “Culture of Newtonianism 1687-1800”, used for historical context. “In the 1690s the English educated elites possessed a new and extraordinary cultural research: Newton’s own science” (Dobbs 65). This continues in the 18th century, when european exceptionalism begins to arise due to the spread of new science and math. “In lecture given throughout Britain and in the Low Countries…Desaguliers offered almost any skilled craftsman, merchant, or self-improving listener”. (Dobbs 78). There are pictures on pg 79, 80, 81, and 84 from Newton’s assistant’s A Course of Experimental Philosophy showing how humans struggle against gravity and inertia and how these forces can be measured. The caption says this is what led to the invention of the steam engine and waterwheel. I will use this illustration on my website.

Kahn Academy is a respected educational website that partners with the College Board. Their mission “is to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.” The specific course I use is narrated by the popular John Green. The secondary source course’s transcript is reliable. To give historical context, I will paraphrase from a chapter, created by Ecogeek, within the World history 1750 -1900 Enlightenment and Revolution section of “Crash Course: You ain’t the boss of me! Oh, maybe you are”. According to Crash Course History, the Industrial Revolution was the most important revolution in the history of mankind, because it changed the way we lived, as opposed to revolutions which, for the most part, only temporarily changed territorial borders. The Industrial Revolution mechanized many jobs previously requiring lots of human labor. To this day, we are still very much impacted by the Industrial Revolution. We would not even have phones without Newton’s new science and new math. “In which John Green wraps up revolutions month with what is arguably the most revolutionary of modern revolutions, the Industrial Revolution. While very few leaders were beheaded in the course of this one, it changed the lives of more people more dramatically than any of the political revolutions we've discussed. So, why did the Industrial Revolution happen around 1750 in the United Kingdom? Coal. Easily accessible coal, it turns out. All this, plus you'll finally learn the difference between James Watt and Thomas Newcomen, and will never again be caught telling people that your blender has a 900 Newcomen motor” (EcoGeek 1).

“Events – Topic Overview.” Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies, 
	www.newton.ac.uk/events. Accessed 14 Mar. 2017.
Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies is a respected, academic institution whose purpose is to provide a mathematical education to the general public for today’s technological world. This secondary source proves that the Newtonian Culture lives on even to this day, because the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies holds many events, lectures, online studies to help the general public around the world further their math skills. From the “Events” page under “Overview”, I will use this important quote in my paper: “INI holds different types of events in many different areas of the mathematical sciences including scientific programmes, workshops, Satellite Meetings, Open for Business events, Scoping Meetings and Follow-up Meetings. In addition, INI holds various events and initiatives that are suitable for a general scientific audience or the general public including Rothschild Seminars and Cambridge Science Festival talks. Use the calendar to view all events and filter by date or event type” (Events 1). The sociocultural of the Newtonian Culture was very successfully spread globally. I will use an image from this site which shows an educational lecture.  Similarly to the lectures by early Newton promoter, J. T. Desaguliers, INI gives higher mathematics instruction and technology training to its local residents in Cambridge, England.  Similarly to the Newtonian Culture’s spread around the world during the IR, INI’s education by international lecturers spread globally via their online seminars.

Feedback From A Young Visitor. Comment on “Events – Topic Overview.” Isaac Newton

Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies is a respected academic institution whose purpose is to provide mathematical education to the public in today’s world. It has a worldwide audience due to their online informative sessions and courses. This secondary source proves that the Newtonian Culture lives even to this day, because the Isaac Newton Institute for Mathematical Studies holds many events, lectures, online studies to help the general public further their math skills, needed in today’s technological age. This testimonial, used in my paper, proves the INI programs reach today’s audience: “I really enjoyed the talk and found out lots of things about maths that I didn't know before Feedback from a young visitor to an INI public talk” (Events 1).

Kenneth M. Golden received his B. A. from Dartmouth College and has a Masters and Ph. D. from New York University in mathematics. He is Professor of Mathematics and Adjunct Professor of Bioengineering in the University of Utah in the Department of Mathematics. He has won many awards and honors including one from the American Mathematical Society and Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics. In 2012, Professor Golden won the Distinguished Scholarly & Creative Research Award. Therefore, this distinguished professor of mathematics is a reliable source. From this professor’s secondary source course, I will use this historical context quote in my paper, “With historical hindsight, it can be said that the development of calculus is certainly one of the greatest intellectual achievements of the past two millenia. Without calculus, most of the incredible advances in science and engineering which occurred in the twentieth century and have become part of everyday life, such as air and space travel, television, computers, weather prediction, medical imaging, nuclear bombs, wireless phones, the internet, microwave ovens, etc., could not have happened. Calculus provides the language and basic concepts used to formulate most of the fundamental laws and principles of the various disciplines throughout the physical, mathematical, biological, economic and social sciences, as well as electrical, mechanical, computer, bio-, civil, and materials engineering“ (Golden 1).

“Industrial Revolution.” Encyclopædia Britannica. 
	www.britannica.com/event/Industrial-Revolution#ref131874, 2011.
The Encyclopædia Britannica has been one of the most respected research reference sources for centuries. Its contributors include 110 Nobel Prize winners and five American presidents. It is an Encyclopædia printed by a company. The article is written by the Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, so it is credible. To give historical context and set dates, I will paraphrase in my paper and use a picture from this important source. From the first chapter, “The First Industrial Revolution” I will use a quote to show how the British government gained a monopoly through their export policy and capitalism grew during the Industrial Revolution.  From “The Second Industrial Revolution” section, I will discuss corporate ownerships and oligarchies. The oligarchy-like ownership gave way to more capitalist ownership of stocks of corporate companies. I will also paraphrase from this secondary source quote to give context about the expansion of the IR into other countries (France, Belgium, Soviet Union, China, India), in particular the influence of nationalism in Germany, bringing in European exceptionalism and global expansion. The Industrial Revolution mechanized many jobs that had previously required much human labor.  The image I use from this is an example of a power loom that required the operation of only a few women.

Jacob, Margaret C. Scientific Culture and the Making of the Industrial West. Oxford University 
	Press, 1997. 
The author, Margaret Jacob, is a history professor at UCLA and was educated at Cornell University. She has won many awards including the Guggenheim Fellowship for Humanities, US & Canada. Her history book is a reliable source. Oxford University Press is one of the most prestigious publishing companies in the world. From this history book, I use many quotes in my paper about the education system and entrepreneurial opportunities in England, as compared to other countries. I found a quote that proves how accelerated math existed in England and will compare it to a quote about the French “educational policies intended to make citizens who would contribute to the war effort.” I will use this secondary source for historical context about the impact of the Scientific Revolution, Enlightenment, and European exceptionalism.

	it?”. Massachusetts Institute of Technology: MIT, 
	www-math.mit.edu/~djk/calculus_beginners/chapter01/section02.html. Accessed 20 
	Feb. 2017.
Daniel Kleitman is a professor of mathematics at MIT and his specific title is Emeritus Professor of Applied Mathematics Combinatorics, Operations Research. He received the A.B. from Cornell in 1954, the A.M. and Ph.D. in physics from Harvard. He also did a NSF postdoctoral fellowship at the Niels Bohr Institute and at Harvard, he was appointed assistant professor of physics at Brandeis. Professor Kleitman joined the MIT mathematics faculty in applied mathematics as associate professor in 1966 and became a professor in 1969. This is a reliable source. This freshman lecture provides good historical context on what calculus does and its importance, “Calculus is the study of how things change. It provides a framework for modeling systems in which there is change, and a way to deduce the predictions of such models” (Kleitman 1). It is a relevant secondary source used in my paper.

Landes, David S. The Unbound Prometheus Technological change and industrial development in 
	Western Europe from 1750 to the present. Cambridge at the University Press, 1969.
David Landes (1924- 2013) was a Professor of History at Harvard University and author of many history and economics books, so this source is reliable. Cambridge at the University Press is one of the most prestigious publishing companies in the world.  In my paper, I use several secondary source quotes from this historical book about the spread of the Newtonian Culture. Two quotes give historical context about government trading policies of the time and what goods were traded with China. Another quote, in particular, proves that even an ordinary British citizen had received an accelerated mathematics education for their time, “Even the ordinary millwright...was usually a fair arithmetician, knew something of geometry, levelling and mensuration, and in some cases possessed a very competent knowledge of practical mathematics. He could calculate velocities, strength and power of machines; could draw in plan and section” (Landes 63). These quotes show European Exceptionalism and global expansion.

Marks, Robert B. The Origins of the Modern World: A Global and Environmental Narrative from 
	the Fifteenth to the Twenty-First Century. 3rd ed., Rowman and Littlefield, 2007.
This is a historical book used in the CSS social studies class’ assigned reading, so it is reliable. Marks is a Richard & Billie Deihl Distinguished Professor of History in the Department of History at Whittier College in California. Rowman & Littlefield is a company that ”publishes high-quality college texts, entertaining and informative books for general readers, and professional and scholarly books…” In my paper, I use multiple secondary source quotes from this college text.  Two quotes are about the spread of industrialization to France and Germany and their political context. In the “Industrial Revolution and Its Consequences, 1750-1850” chapter, the vast coal supply in China is discussed, yet the question is poised as to why didn’t industrialization happen in China. This quote represents the views of many in recent history (that is disproved in the article by two professors from Lewis and Clark College) “…Industrial Revolution, there is little evidence that the mechanics and tinkerers who developed those machine were ‘scientists’ or even hand any scientific training at all…” (Marks 117).

Meli, Domenico Bertoloni. Equivalence and Priority: Newton versus Leibniz: Including 
	Leibniz's Unpublished Manuscripts on the Principia 1st THUS Edition. Clarendon Press, 
	1993.
This historical book’s author, Domenico Bertoloni Meli, received his Ph.D. from Cambridge University in the History and Philosophy of Science in 1988. He has received many fellowships and grants, most recently a John Simon Guggenheim Fellowship. He has also been a member of the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, worked at the Max Planck Institute for History of Science in Berlin, and received fellowships and grants from Indiana University, the Dibner Institute, the National Science Foundation, the Wellcome Trust for the History of Medicine, and Jesus College, Cambridge. Domenico Bertoloni Meli is currently a professor at Indiana University Bloomington. This source is credible. In my paper, I use Meli’s map to show the spread of calculus throughout England and Europe, in order to prove that in England, Newton’s calculus was popular, whereas on mainland western Europe, Leibnizian mathematics was embraced. Almost like Apple supporters vs. Microsoft, allies of Newtonian mathematics centered around Oxford and London, whereas Leibniz calculus was more embraced on the European mainland. Curiously, Leibniz’ popularity furthered the audience for Newton’s Principia, which was initially appreciated for its astonishing work in gravity and later spread by Newton’s followers. This secondary source gives the historical context for the spread of the new math and new science.

Merton, Robert K. Science, Technology & Society in Seventeenth Century England. Howard 
	Fertig, 1970.
The author of this historical book graduated from Harvard and was an American sociologist. He spent most of his career teaching at Columbia University, where he attained the rank of University Professor. His awards include the National Medal of Science for Behavioral and Social Science, so this book is a credible, secondary source. I use this source in my paper as another criteria for why the IR happened in England and as an example sociocultural climate. Merton’s quote proves that inventions do not happen in isolation, but rather social interaction and exchange is necessary for an inventor. This condition existed in England during the IR, as an example of European exceptionalism.

Palmer, R. R., and Joel Colton. A History of the Modern World Since 1815. Alfred A. Knopf, 
	Inc., 1984.
This global history textbook is reliable because it was used as a source for a CSS homework assignment. Additionally, R. R. Palmer was a distinguished historian at both Princeton and Yale, while Joel Colton earned his Master’s degree from Columbia. Through conquest and dominance of the sea, England created a colonial empire, traded across oceans, and had the capital to finance new ideas (Industrial 429). In the 1800s and 1900s, the textile industry was one of the leading products of the economies of many countries around the world. India was a big producer of textiles, because it had a huge population and a strong cottage industry. England wanted to compete for the cotton market but did not have a large enough population to support a cottage industry well. England wanted to mechanize the weaving process (Industrial 429).

Picard, Liz. “The Great Exhibition.” The British Library Victorian Britain, 4 June 2015, 
	www.bl.uk/victorian-britain/articles/the-great-exhibition. Accessed 14 March 2017.
Liza Picard researches and writes about the history of London. The website secondary source is the British Library, so it is reliable.  In my paper, from the section labeled “The Exhibits”, I will use this quote that lists some of the more popular inventions displayed at the Great Exhibition during the IR. It shows what Newton’s new science had lead to: “Britain, as host, occupied half the display space inside, with exhibits from the home country and the Empire. The biggest of all was the massive hydraulic press that had lifted the metal tubes of a bridge at Bangor invented by Stevenson. Each tube weighed 1,144 tons yet the press was operated by just one man. Next in size was a steam-hammer that could with equal accuracy forge the main bearing of a steamship or gently crack an egg. There were adding machines which might put bank clerks out of a job… There was a printing machine that could turn out 5,000 copies of the popular periodical the Illustrated London News in an hour…” (Picard, 1). This relevant quote shows how successful the IR was. From the section titled “The Visitors”, the admission cost and type of visitors are discussed, “Queen Victoria opened the Exhibition on 1 May, on schedule. She became a frequent visitor. At first the price of admission was £3 for gentlemen, £2 for ladies. They came in throngs, in their elegant carriages, leaving them at a separate entrance to be valet-parked. Saturday mornings were reserved for invalids. From 24th May the masses were let in for only a shilling a head. And they came in their thousands, factory workers sent by their employers, country villagers sent by benevolent landowners, strings of schoolchildren. The country men came wearing their best smocks, staring at all the Londoners and foreigners” (Picard 1).

“Queen Victoria's private diaries made available online.” BBC News, 24 May 2012, 
	http://www.bbc.com/news/uk-18183157.
This secondary source, BBC News, is the leading news source in England. Because of this, it is credible. Queen Victoria’s private diaries are not available to individuals or high schools. Victoria, Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, wrote a 43,000 page journal throughout her long lifetime.  In them, she wrote about the crowds of people from all around the world who marveled at the many inventions displayed at the Great Exhibition.  On my website, I use a photograph of Queen Elizabeth reviewing her Great-great-grandmother’s journals.

	mathematics. Vanderbilt University, Aug. 2006, 
	math.vanderbilt.edu/~schectex/courses/whystudy.html. Accessed 20 Feb. 2017.
The author of this essay, Eric Schechter, is Professor Emeritus Vanderbilt University, where he was honored in 2013. He has his Ph.D., University of Chicago, 1978. The webpage says: “This web page has been selected as one of the best educational resources on the Web, and has received the coveted "StudyWeb Excellence Award," from StudyWeb.” This is a reliable source for my paper. The professor concludes with, “the steam engine, developed over the next century, making possible the industrial revolution” (Schechter 1). The first lecture within his calculus course is important because it contrasts the world before and after calculus. “In part, students should study calculus for the same reasons that they study Darwin, Marx, Voltaire, or Dostoyevsky: These ideas are a basic part of our culture; these ideas have shaped how we perceive the world and how we perceive our place in the world” (Schechter 1). I will paraphrase from this valuable course.

“Sir Issac Newton.” Encyclopædia Britannica. 
	https://www.britannica.com/biography/Isaac-Newton, 2011.
The Encyclopædia Britannica has been one of the most respected research reference sources for centuries. Its contributors include 110 Nobel Prize winners and five American presidents. It is an Encyclopædia printed by a company. The article is written by the Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, so it is a credible, secondary source encyclopedia for my paper and website’s portrait. Like many theoretical physicists even today, Newton had to develop a new math to communicate his new science. After his death, due to a priority dispute over the invention of calculus, a.k.a. The Calculus Wars, Newton’s followers passionately promoted Newton’s new math and science.  These new “tools” were embraced by many--general public and scholars alike-- and lead to the many inventions of the IR.  For this, the Newtonian Culture was born and spread around the world.  Most people consider Sir Isaac Newton to be the “Father of Modern Science”.

Stewart, Larry. The Rise of Public Science: Rhetoric, Technology, and Natural Philosophy in 
	Newtonian Britain. Cambridge University Press, 1992.
Larry Stewart has written over 15 books on science and philosophy, including his most popular “Practical Matter”. Cambridge University Press is a prestigious publishing company. Therefore, this is a reliable source. In my paper, I use a quote from this secondary source historical book that proves that Newton’s theorems in the Principia, including those laws of motion learned from the cosmos, made their way into everyday life and solved mechanical challenges in the IR.

Strayer, Robert W. Ways of the World. 2nd ed., Bedford/St. Martin, 2013.
Robert W. Strayer has his Ph.D. from University of Wisconsin. He taught high school world history in Ethiopia and at universities around the world. He received Chancellor's Awards for Excellence in Teaching and for Excellence in Scholarship, so this is a reliable source. I use two quotes from this secondary source textbook in my paper.  They show the impact of Sir Isaac Newton’s discoveries that were exchanged for centuries. “By the time Newton died, a revolutionary new understanding of the physical universe had emerged among educated Europeans” (Strayer 744). This quote from a high school social studies textbook is incorrect, which I will prove in my research paper.  According to multiple sources, including the Britannica (https://www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Newcomen) many people tried to invent a steam engine to remove water from flooded coal mines.  The first person to invent a functional steam engine was an ironmonger from England.  Thomas Newcomen was aided by a friend, a plumber.  Although a “country bumpkin”, Newcomen was aware of the latest scientific technology through a friendship with Robert Hooke of the Royal Society.  Additionally, many in the general population of England learned higher math skills in school, thanks to the popularity of Newton’s book the Principia and a Newtonian Culture that emerged first in England.  I used page 829 of this source for a common date of the start of the IR—1750--even though this source dates the steam engine to 1712, twenty-five years after the publication of Newton’s Principia.

“Thomas Newcomen British engineer and inventor.” Encyclopædia Britannica. 
	www.britannica.com/biography/Thomas-Newcomen, 2011.
The Encyclopædia Britannica has been one of the most respected research reference sources for centuries. Its contributors include 110 Nobel Prize winners and five American presidents. It is an Encyclopædia printed by a company. The article is written by the Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica, so it is a credible, secondary source encyclopedia. My chosen quote used in my paper proves that Thomas Newcomen was not an educated European (Strayer 744), but rather an ironmonger. He was aided in his invention of the first functioning atmospheric steam engine by a plumber. Newcomen was familiar with Newton’s ideas through Robert Hooke of the Royal Society, a follower who spread the Newtonian Culture. This is contrary to Strayer’s quote. “As an ironmonger at Dartmouth, Newcomen became aware of the high cost of using the power of horses to pump water out of the Cornish tin mines. With his assistant John Calley (or Cawley), a plumber, he experimented for more than 10 years with a steam pump” (Editors of Encyclopædia Britannica 1).The Newcomen steam engine was improved upon for decades after its invention. I use an image of Newcomen’s 1856 steam engine on my website.

“Thomas Newcomen.” Famous Scientists, 2017, 
	https://www.famousscientists.org/thomas-newcomen/.
This secondary source is an informational website on famous scientists throughout the centuries. It is a credible source. Although an ironmonger (nail maker and tool seller to mining industry) from rural England, Newcomen was familiar with Sir Isaac Newton’s new science through Robert Hooke of the Royal Society. Newton’s new science –physics--required higher mathematics skills and England’s schools had been teaching Newton’s new math since 1720, thanks to the popularity of Newton’s book, the Principia, and the Newtonian Culture that sprang up after Newton’s death.

Weiner, Jerry Ph.D, et al. Barron's Global History Volume Two: The Industrial Revolution to the 
	Age of Globalization. Barron’s Educational Series, 2007.
Amazon says, “This comprehensive new high school textbook is designed to meet tenth-grade curricula as specified by the New York State Board of Regents. It also matches the curricula of many secondary school social studies programs throughout the country.” One author, Mark Willner, has written over fifteen history books, so he is a reliable source. Barrons is a respected educational textbook company. This textbook is a credible secondary source that I use in my paper. From this source, I paraphrase about the IR in Latin America from these sections: "Chapter Five: Political Change and Global Nationalism in Latin America, "Political Change and Global Nationalism—Latin America. “Problems Develop After Independence (1890-1850)”. On pages 154- 155, this source discusses why the IR did not happen in Latin America countries and why these countries did not industrialize. I focus on quotes about the education system in Latin America to show why these countries were lacking in one of the technological components needed to industrialize, namely math skills for the general population.  This source is important because the Industrial Revolution spread all around the world and Latin American nations wanted to industrialize but did not for multiple reasons, including the leaders’ decision to focus on exports of raw materials rather than putting money into fostering industrialization. Latin America had some of the components which caused Britain to industrialize, such as a low population (due to many deaths during its revolutionary wars) and flooded mines. The key component that Latin America did not have, but that Britain did have, was the accelerated mathematical education that the general population in England was given. Additionally, in Latin America, only a certain segment of the population received education, as my quote shows. Additionally, I have an important quote that show the result of Latin America not industrializing.

Williams, Nigel. “How the Great Exhibition of 1851 still influences science today.” The 
Guardian, 28 August 2015, 
www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2015/aug/28/how-the-great-exhibition-of-1851-still-influences-science-today. Accessed 11 Mar. 2017.
The writer of this secondary source article within England’s prestigious The Guardian is Nigel Williams. He is a respected novelist, screenwriter and playwright in his own right. He is the author of The Wimbledon Trilogy and his latest novel Unfaithfully Yours (2013). This important source gives the historical context at the start of the second period of the IR for my paper. It shows how the IR spread around the world via the visitors to the Great Exhibition, “Six million people visited the Crystal Palace to see cutting-edge science and technology…” (Williams 1). It shows how the IR inventions spread, and it is in contrast to the 17th century populace.“Visitors to the Crystal Palace, a marvel in its own right, were treated to demonstrations of cutting-edge technology of the day, including electric telegraphs, microscopes, a prototype facsimile machine, a revolving lighthouse light and an early submarine. This was the first, and perhaps the only time that such a large scale effort was made to promote technology to the masses” (Williams 1).“The Great Exhibition aimed to show that technology was the key to a better future, a belief that proved a motivating force behind the Industrial Revolution. Its legacy has supported hundreds of innovators over the last 150 years through the Commission’s fellowships, a fact that has undoubtedly contributed to the UK becoming a world-leader in research and development (R&D) ” (Williams 1).An example of how the Great Exhibition and its Research Fellowships spread the IR is: “Among the first beneficiaries of the programme was a young physicist from New Zealand who came to Cambridge in 1895, named Ernest Rutherford, whose pioneering research on the structure of matter would eventually win him the Nobel prize for Chemistry. A total of thirteen Nobel laureates have received early career funding from the Commission’s scholarships, including Paul Dirac and Peter Higgs” (Williams 1).</p>
